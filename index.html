      <h3>World War z</h3>
      <p>
         When former U.N. investigator Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt) and <br />
         his family get stuck in urban gridlock, he senses that it's <br />
         no ordinary traffic jam. His suspicions are confirmed <br />
         when, suddenly, the city erupts into chaos. A lethal virus, <br />
         spread through a single bite, is turning healthy people <br />
         into something vicious, unthinking and feral. As the <br />
         pandemic threatens to consume humanity, Gerry leads a <br />
         worldwide search to find the source of the infection and, <br />
         with luck, a way to halt its spread. <br />

      <p>
         As a suicide survivor, demon hunter John Constantine <br />

         he knows that when he dies, he's got a one-way ticket to <br />
         Satan's realm unless he can earn enough goodwill to <br />
         climb God's stairway to heaven. While helping <br />
         policewoman Angela Dodson (Rachel Weisz) investigate <br />
         her identical twin's apparent suicide, Constantine <br />
         becomes caught up in a supernatural plot involving both <br />
         demonic and angelic forces. Based on the DC/Vertigo <br />
